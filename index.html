	<p>
		Hey, thank you for visiting my website. My name is Penelope and I am a college student pursuing Digital Design. During 2020, I discovered that baking is one of my passions.
		I want to share my recipes with my audience and teach them how to bake. </p>
		>&quot;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.&quot;</blockquote>
 
	<h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Season Package: $95</li>
		<li>Patron Package: $200</li>
